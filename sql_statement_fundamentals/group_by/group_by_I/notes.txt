The Group By clause must appear right
after a FROM or WHERE statement

In the SELECT statement, columns must
either have an aggregate function or
be in the GROUP BY call.

WHERE statements should not refer
to the aggregation result.

If you want to sort results based
on the aggregate, make sure to 
reference the entire function
